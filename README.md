Medico

Short Description
-----------------

A small piece of Annoy-Ware that is designed to annoy the user until they have taken their medication.

Project Goal
------------

Fulfil the final wish of a close friend of mine who passed away, at the age of 32, shortly before Christmas 2013. He'd lamented on the fact that there weren't any apps that could help him to take all of his prescribes medications on time.
